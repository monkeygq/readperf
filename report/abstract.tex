\section*{Abstract}

Performance measurement of software under Linux is done with the perf system. Perf consists of kernel code and an userspace tool. The tool records the data to an file which can be analyzed later. Understanding this data format is necessary for individual software performance analysis.

This report provides information about the data structures used to read the data file. An application was written to demonstrate how the data file can be read. For a given data file, the application shows the frequency with which source code functions are used.

\section{The perf file format}
This section will give a detailed description of the perf file format. The file format is designed in such a way that it is upwards and downwards compatible. This is very convenient for the users, but makes the file format more complicated and therefore more difficult to understand. Nevertheless, the following description should give enough information to work with the perf data file.

In the tables describing the structures the convention for the data types is as following. \code{u<n>} is an unsigned integer with n bits. \code{char[<n>]} is a zero terminated string in a field with n bytes of memory. Another name in the type field refers to another structure.
